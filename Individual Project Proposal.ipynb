    "For this research question, regression analysis would likely be the best fit because it allows me to analyze the relationship between the frequency of different types of social interactions (predictors) and loneliness scores (outcome variable). Regression also allows me to examine multiple types of social interactions (e.g., board games, coffee meetups, video chats) and determine each one‚Äôs association with loneliness\n",
    "\n",
    "**Assumptions:**\n",
    " **Linearity**: Check if there is a linear relationship between the independent variable (frequency of interactions) and the dependent variable (loneliness score). **Independence:** Ensure that observations are independent of each other, and **Normality:** For linear regression, check that the residuals are approximately normally distributed. This can be assessed using Q-Q plots.\n",

    "**HYPOTHESIS**\n",
    "- Null Hypothesis (H0): There is no significant correlation between the frequency of different types of social interactions (e.g., board games, coffee meetups, video chats) and reported feelings of loneliness among participants. In other words, increased frequency of social interactions does not lead to a reduction in loneliness scores.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Alternative Hypothesis (H1): There is a significant negative correlation between the frequency of different types of social interactions (e.g., board games, coffee meetups, video chats) and reported feelings of loneliness among participants. This suggests that as the frequency of social interactions increases, loneliness scores decrease, indicating that more frequent social interactions are associated with lower levels of loneliness."
